# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenConstructionERP are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added — Professional BOQ features
- **Custom Columns** with 7 one-click presets — Procurement (Supplier, Lead Time, PO Number, PO Status), Notes, Quality Control (QC Status, Inspector, Date), Sustainability (CO₂, EPD, Material Source), **GAEB / iTWO Style** (KG-Bezug, Lohn-EP, Material-EP, Geräte-EP, Sonstiges-EP, Wagnis %), **ÖNORM / BRZ Style** (LV-Position, Stichwort, Lohn-Anteil %, Aufschlag %, Lieferant), **BIM Integration** (IFC GUID, Element ID, Storey, Phase). Manual form for everything else. Live fill-rate progress bar shows how complete each column is.
- **Renumber positions** with gap-of-10 scheme (`01`, `01.10`, `01.20`, `02`, `02.10`) — matches RIB iTWO and BRZ professional output. Lets you insert `01.15` later without renumbering everything else. New `POST /boqs/{id}/renumber` endpoint + toolbar button.
- **Excel round-trip with custom columns** — supplier, notes and procurement values are now exported to .xlsx and survive a full import → edit → export cycle. Number-typed columns are formatted as numbers in the spreadsheet.
- **Project Health bar** on Project Detail — circular progress with 5 checkpoints (BOQ created → positions added → all priced → validation run → no errors) and a single "Next step" button that always points at the first incomplete item.

### Added — Security hardening (from QA / pentest report)
- **Strong password policy** — 8+ chars, ≥1 letter, ≥1 digit, blacklist of 24 common/leaked passwords. `password`, `12345678` and friends are now rejected with a clear 422.
- **Login rate limit** — 10 attempts per minute per IP, returns 429 with `Retry-After` header.
- **JWT freshness check** — old tokens are invalidated automatically when the user changes password (via `password_changed_at` column + `iat` comparison in `get_current_user_payload`).
- **Security headers middleware** — `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy` (relaxed for SPA, excluded from /docs and /redoc), `Strict-Transport-Security` (HTTPS only).
- **Schedule date validation** — `start_date > end_date` is now rejected with a clear 422 (Pydantic `model_validator`).
- **PDF upload magic-byte check** — `/takeoff/documents/upload` now rejects JPGs/HTML/etc. renamed to `.pdf`.
- **Cross-user permission boundary verified** — User B gets 403 on every attempt to read/modify/delete User A's data (end-to-end test in place).

### Added — UX & frontend
- **User-friendly API error messages** — `ApiError` now extracts the actual FastAPI `detail` string instead of `"API 500: Internal Server Error"`. Covers FastAPI 422 validation arrays, generic envelopes, and per-status fallbacks (400/401/403/404/409/413/422/429/500/502/503/504). Network errors and `AbortError` get their own friendly text. 14 i18n keys × 21 locales added.
- **Modernized update notification** in the sidebar — gradient emerald/teal/cyan card with pulsing Sparkles icon, grouped highlights (New / Fixed / Polished), in-app changelog link (scrolls to `/about#changelog`), GitHub release link, change-count badge. Caches the GitHub response in `localStorage` (1h TTL) so multi-tab sessions don't burn the unauthenticated rate limit.
- **Continue your work** card on Dashboard — gradient card showing the most recently updated BOQ with name, project, position count and grand total; one click jumps back to the editor.
- **Role-aware ChangeOrders Approve button** — hidden for non-admin/manager roles; an "Awaiting approval" amber badge appears instead, so users no longer click into a 403.
- **Highlight unpriced positions** in the BOQ grid — subtle amber background and 3px left border on rows where `qty > 0` but `unit_rate = 0`.
- **Duplicate-name guard** for new projects — typing a name that matches an existing project shows an amber warning and requires a second click to confirm.
- **Single source-of-truth** for app version — `package.json` is the only place to edit. Sidebar, About page, error logger, update checker and bug-report params all import `APP_VERSION` from a Vite-injected define.
- **Changelog** entries filled in for v0.5.0, v0.6.0, v0.7.0 (previously the in-app history jumped from v0.4 → v0.7 with no notes).
- **Accessibility** — `<h1>` (sr-only) on /login and /register, `name` and `id` attributes on all auth inputs, `aria-label` on password show/hide buttons, dead `_SavedSessionsList` removed.
- **Keyboard shortcuts dialog** — removed misleading shortcuts that browsers reserved (`Ctrl+N`, `Ctrl+Shift+N`); fixed buggy "Ctrl then Shift then V" separator; added `g r` → Reports and `g t` → Tendering navigation sequences.

### Fixed — backend critical bugs
- **`ChangeOrders POST /items` returned 500 for every payload** — `MissingGreenlet` on `order.code` after `_recalculate_cost_impact` (which calls `expire_all`) triggered a lazy load in async context. Fix: capture identifying fields before the recalc, then `refresh(item)` after.
- **`5D /generate-budget` returned 500 on missing `boq_id`** — bare `uuid.UUID(str(...))` raised on empty body. Fix: validate explicitly with try/except → 422 on bad input. Auto-pick the most recently updated BOQ when omitted.
- **Project soft-delete was leaky** — `DELETE /projects/{id}` set `status=archived`, but the project still came back from `GET`, list, and BOQ list. Fix: `get_project` gains `include_archived` flag (default `False`); `list_projects` defaults to `exclude_archived=True`; BOQ verify treats archived as 404.
- **Requirements module tables were missing on fresh installs** — module models were not imported in `main.py`/`alembic env.py`, so `Base.metadata.create_all()` skipped them. Fix: added the missing imports; same for 6 other previously missing module models.
- **Custom Columns SQLAlchemy JSON persistence** — only the FIRST added column was being saved due to in-place dict mutation. Fix: build a fresh `dict` and call `flag_modified(boq, "metadata_")` to defeat value-based change detection.
- **Custom column edit silently rewrote `total`/`unit_rate`** — `update_position` re-derived pricing from `metadata.resources` on every metadata patch. Fix: only re-derive when `quantity` actually changed OR the resources list itself differs from what's stored. Critical correctness fix for resource-priced positions.

### Changed
- The visible "Quick Start Estimate" flow now uses **gap-of-10 ordinals** by default — new positions get `01.40`, `01.50` etc. instead of `01.4`, `01.5`.
- `update_position` is stricter about when it touches pricing fields — only quantity/rate/resource changes recalculate `total`. Pure metadata patches leave the existing total intact.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: pip install -e ./backend** — `[project.urls]` was placed before `dependencies` in pyproject.toml, breaking editable installs and PyPI builds
- **CRITICAL: BOQ Duplication crash** — MissingGreenlet error when duplicating BOQ (eagerly capture ORM attributes before session expiry)
- **CRITICAL: CWICR import 500 error** — ProcessPoolExecutor fails on Windows/uvicorn; replaced with asyncio.to_thread
- **Security: Path traversal** — Document/takeoff download endpoints now resolve symlinks and sandbox-check paths
- **Security: CORS** — Block wildcard `*` origins in production mode with warning
- **Security: Login enumeration** — Deactivated accounts return same 401 as invalid credentials; password policy not revealed before auth
- **Security: Catalog price factor** — Bounded to `0 < factor ≤ 10` with explicit validation
- **Docker quickstart** — Dockerfile copies full backend (incl. README.md for hatchling), installs `[server]` extras, creates frontend/dist dir, uses development mode
- **Alembic migration** — Replaced broken init migration (DROP non-existent tables) with no-op baseline
- **Nginx** — Added CSP, HSTS, Permissions-Policy security headers
- **35 test errors** — Marked standalone test_full_platform.py with pytest.mark.skip
